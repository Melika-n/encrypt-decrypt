# encrypt-decrypt
Encrypting and decrypting strings using C language and ascii map

Here, using arrays in C language, we find the length of a string and use it to traverse a string. For encryption, we move each character of the string forward 3 characters according to the ascii table.
For decryption, we go through this process in reverse.
